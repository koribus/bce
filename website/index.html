  <h1>Belper Community Energy</h1>
	<h2>Who are we?</h2>
	<p><strong>Belper Community Energy</strong> is a recently formed group of Belper area residents who share a commitment to reducing Belper&apos;s Carbon Footprint by implementing Renewable Energy systems and in doing so, providing community benefit</p>
	<p>Some of us are Councillors. some have strong ties with Transition Belper and some are already professionally engaged in Sustainabilty and Carbon reduction work.</p>
	<p><strong>We mean business</strong>, so we are on track to form a Community Benefit Company in early 2023 which will:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>enable us to raise funds and enter into contracts with partner organisations.</li>
		<li>be non-profit, volunteer-led, and aimed at providing benefit to the Belper Area Community</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>What&apos;s our plan?</h2>
	<p>Until 4 years ago, renewables projects (like rooftop solar) were Government subsidised which enabled Community Energy groups to generate surplus revenue every year to fund more renewables or other local community projects, as well as repaying investors.</p>
	<p>This is no longer the case. There are now no subsidies and the price of electricity export to the grid is currently too low.</p>
	<h2>So how does big solar co-op work with us?</h2>
	<p>The Big Solar idea is to <strong>operate at scale:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>owns and manages all installations and sells the energy bulk purchase of ethically sourced equipment
shared design, technical and contract resources</li>
		<li>spreads business risk over many sites distributed nationally able to generate surplus for more solar</li>
		<li>runs a design, training and support hub for local community groups across the UK</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Belper Community Energy</strong> will</p>
	<ul>
		<li>identify potential rooftop solar sites</li>
		<li>engage with site owners and discuss opportunities/feasibility</li>
		<li>do preliminary designs and refer promising sites to Big Solar Coop for more thorough assessment</li>
		<li>provide local support throuhout the project</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>What&apos;s in it for you?</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Free, no obligation feasibility assessment</li>
		<li>No upfront costs</li>
		<li>Lower and predictable electricity price over contract life (10yr+)</li>
		<li>Big Solar Coop implements, owns and maintains the system</li>
		<li>Option to buy panels at end of contract (productive life of panels is 25yr+)</li>
		<li>Reduced carbon footprint on your site</li>
		<li>Belper Community Energy may be able to help with other carbon reduction opportunties</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Things to consider</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Is your roof geometry suitable?</li>
		<li>Is your roof sound â€“ are you planning major repairs?</li>
		<li>Do you consume a lot of daytime electricity?</li>
		<li>Do you want/need to reduce your carbon footprint?</li>
		<li>Long contract -  does your roof/building have a secure future?</li>
	</ul>
